# PlayIt App:

-r dotenv/config: This part of the script uses the -r (or --require) flag to require the dotenv/config module before running your application. The dotenv package is commonly used to load environment variables from a .env file, and dotenv/config loads these variables into process.env. By requiring dotenv/config in this way, it ensures that the environment variables are loaded before your application starts, making them available in your application code.

--experimental-json-modules: This part enables support for ECMAScript (ES) Modules in your Node.js application, particularly support for .mjs files. ECMAScript Modules are a standard for organizing and importing JavaScript code, similar to CommonJS modules (.js files). This flag is used to enable support for using ES Modules in your Node.js project, as they are not enabled by default in all Node.js versions.
